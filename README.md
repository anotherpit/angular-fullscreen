angular-fullscreen
==================

AngularJS Ã— HTML5 Fullscreen API

Why?
====
* [Browser suppport](http://caniuse.com/#feat=fullscreen) still sucks a bit;
* [angular-fullscreen](https://github.com/fabiobiondi/angular-fullscreen) by [fabiobiondi](https://github.com/fabiobiondi) is a bit too opinionated (e.g. adds its own classes and events);
* So is [ng-fullscreen](https://github.com/shader/ng-fullscreen) by [shader](https://github.com/shader).
